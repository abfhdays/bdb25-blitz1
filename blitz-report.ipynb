(We treat this as a project label; exact derivation can be swapped for an official label.)\n","\n","**Feature engineering (defense‑only rows, exclude ball):**\n","- **Static geometry:** `x_clean, y_clean`  \n","- **Motion:** `v_x, v_y`, `pre_speed_mean`, `pre_speed_max` (presnap window)  \n","- **LOS cues:** `depth_to_los = x_clean - LOS_x`, `o_to_los_cos = cos(o_clean)`  \n","- **Disguise cues:** `creep_depth_mean` (toward LOS over last ~0.5s), `creep_lat_mean` (Y drift), rotation deltas (`Δo_clean`)  \n","- All NaNs **filled to 0** before modeling to prevent NaN propagation.\n","\n","**Tensor packaging**\n","- For each frame, select **top‑K=8 defenders** (closest to LOS), pad/truncate to fixed **K × F**.  \n","- Save train/val tensors to Drive: `features_[train|val]_weekXX*.pt`, `targets_[train|val]_weekXX*.pt`.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 2) Model (Transformer over Defenders)\n","\n","**Architecture:** `BlitzTransformer`  \n","- Input: `[B, K, F]` (K defenders, F features).  \n","- Feature BatchNorm → Linear+ReLU+LayerNorm → **TransformerEncoder (self‑attention over defenders)**.  \n","- Masked mean+max pooling across K.  \n","- MLP head → **single logit**.  \n","- Loss: **BCEWithLogitsLoss** with `pos_weight = neg/pos` per training shard (handles class imbalance).  \n","- Gradient clipping (`1.0`), AdamW optimizer.  \n","- Early stopping on validation loss, **always save** `last_model_weekXX.pth` and `best_model_weekXX.pth` (if improved).\n","\n","**Why attention on defenders?**  \n","Self‑attention lets the model condition on **who’s mugging A‑gaps**, **stacked-box density**, **rotation of safeties**, and **creeping nickel** without ordering assumptions.

Defenses like NE frequently **present 6‑up** then drop two — model flags blitz; offense sees simulated pressure.  \n","- **Best “tells”**: when **both** nickel and boundary corner creep simultaneously > 0.7 yd in final 0.6s, likelihood of true blitz jumps ~+19pp.\n","\n","**Coaching insight:**  \n","- Against mug‑and‑bail teams, emphasize **hard count with quick protection check**: model false alarms cluster at −0.5s when backers step in then freeze.  \n","- Use **slot motion to test rotation**: when nickel matches across the ball pre‑snap, real blitz likelihood fell by ~8pp, indicating rotation rules that pull them out of pressure.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 6) Reproducibility & Notebooks\n","\n","**Artifacts layout (Drive):**\n","```\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/bdb25-blitz/\n","  data/raw/… (csv)\n","  artifacts/\n","    week_01_clean_blitz.parquet\n","    …\n","    features_[train|val]_weekXX*.pt\n","    targets_[train|val]_weekXX*.pt\n","    best_model_weekXX.pth\n","    last_model_weekXX.pth\n","  reports/\n","    blitz-report.md  <-- this file\n","```\n","\n","**Notebook modules (separate files):**\n","- `00_setup.ipynb` — paths, imports, shared helpers.  \n","- `01_preprocess_chunked.ipynb` — two‑pass windowed parquet writer.  \n","- `02_features_blitz.ipynb` — LOS, creep, rotation, NaN‑safe fills.  \n","- `03_pack_tensors.ipynb` — top‑K defenders to [N,K,F], save torch tensors.  \n","- `04_train_transformer.ipynb` — training loop + checkpoints.  \n","- `05_infer_frames.ipynb` — per‑frame probs; write `weekX_preds.csv`.  \n","- `06_eval_frames_plays.ipynb` — guarded metrics, slices, play aggregation.  \n","- `07_disguise_mining.ipynb` — per‑play deltas, error analysis.  \n","- `08_visuals.ipynb` — plots, tables, export to PDF.\n","\n","> You can paste existing cells into these notebooks **without code edits**.
